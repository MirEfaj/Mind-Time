His resurrection was not only proof of His victory over death but the doorway into new life for us. To know Jesus is to see Him as Savior who forgives and as Lord who reigns.

This happens through prayer that is honest, Scripture that we chew on and carry with us, silence where we learn to listen, and obedience that shows we trust Him. Real discipleship is not about fitting Jesus into the margins of life but centering life on Him. In every moment He invites us to know Him, to rest in His peace, and to live with His strength and joy as we learn to walk in the way He walked.",
